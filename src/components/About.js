      <h2>about the developer</h2>
         <p>My name is Maia and I am a fellow creative based out of Charlotte, NC. I am a kinesthetic learner who enjoys building and designing on the web. Web development granted me a creative outlet in which I have been able to fulfill through innovative debugging, algorithm building, and implementing intuitive UI.<br></br>
            On my free time I enjoy being outdoors with my fur babies, photography, creating graphic art, and drinking coffee.
            I am currently enrolled in UNC Charlottes Coding Bootcamp and am on the path to becoming a FullStack
            Developer.<br></br>
